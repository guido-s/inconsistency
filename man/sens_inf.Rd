\title{Decision Inconsistency index for individual studies and leave-one out sensitivity analysis for inconsistency measures}
\usage{
sens_inf(x)

\method{print}{sens_inf}(x, ...)

\method{summary}{sens_inf}(object, ...)

\method{print}{summary.sens_inf}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An R object of class \code{inc}.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments (ignored).}

\item{object}{An R object of class \code{sens_inf}.}
}
\value{
The \code{sens_inf} function generates:
\item{di_stud}{A dataframe displaying the Decision Inconsistency
  Index for each individual primary study.}
\item{di_asi_sens}{A dataframe displaying the results of the
  leave-one-out sensitivity analysis for the Decision Inconsistency
  index and the Across-Studies Inconsistency index.}
}
\description{
Computation of the Decision Inconsistency index for each individual
primary study and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis for the
Decision Inconsistency index and the Across-Studies Inconsistency
index.
}
\details{
The \code{sens_inf} function (i) computes the Decision
Inconsistency index (DI) for each individual primary study and (ii)
performs leave-one-out sensitivity analysis for the DI and for the
Across-Studies Inconsistency index. This function takes, as its
single argument, an object of the class \code{inc}.
